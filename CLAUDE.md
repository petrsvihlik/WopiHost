## Code Style & Build Rules

- **Warnings as errors** is enabled globally (`TreatWarningsAsErrors`).
- **Comment style** (applies to `//` comments and the prose inside `///` XML docs):
  - Write in third person. Never "we"/"our"/"let's" — describe what the code does ("Resolves the owner"), not what the author did.
  - Comment only what is genuinely non-obvious or surprising to a new reader: a gotcha, an ABI/spec quirk, a non-local invariant. If the code is self-explanatory, leave no comment.
  - No meta-commentary: don't justify a choice to a reviewer, don't narrate how the code used to be, don't say "matching X" / "changed to Y".
  - Never reference GitHub issues or PRs by number (`#123`). If the context matters, inline the explanation itself.
  - Keep comments short and concrete; prefer deleting a comment to padding it.
  - Keep the `///` XML doc tags on public APIs (warnings-as-errors require them), but trim their wording to the same bar.
- .NET analyzers and code style enforcement are on (`EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`).
- Follow [.NET Design Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/).
- Centralized package management via `Directory.Packages.props` — specify versions there, not in individual `.csproj` files.
- Single-targeted on `net10.0` (libraries, samples, infra, tests). The v8 line was the last to support `net8.0` / `net9.0`; v9 onward is net10 only. The `tools/wopi-validator/` helper project stays on `net8.0` because the upstream `Microsoft.Office.WopiValidator` NuGet does.
- Build output is centralized under `artifacts/` at the repo root (`UseArtifactsOutput=true` in `Directory.Build.props`) — there are no per-project `bin/`/`obj/` folders.
- Package validation baseline is `8.0.0` — avoid breaking public API changes in NuGet-packaged libraries. Bump in lockstep with releases (auto-bumped by `.github/workflows/release.yml` after each stable release). Packages without a prior release on NuGet.org opt out via `EnablePackageValidation=false` in their `.csproj`.
- `InternalsVisibleTo` is auto-configured for `*.Tests` assemblies.

## Architecture

This is a modular **WOPI protocol host** implementation that integrates custom data sources with Office Online Server / Microsoft 365 for the Web.

### Core Libraries (src/)

- **WopiHost.Abstractions** — Interfaces and contracts: `IWopiStorageProvider`, `IWopiWritableStorageProvider`, `IWopiLockProvider`, `IWopiAccessTokenService`, `IWopiProofValidator`, `IWopiPermissionProvider`, `IDiscoverer`. All other projects depend on this.
- **WopiHost.Core** — WOPI REST endpoints as Minimal APIs (`src/WopiHost.Core/Endpoints/*Endpoints.cs`, wired via `app.MapWopiEndpoints()`), security (JWT auth, WOPI proof validation), and request infrastructure. The override-multiplexed `POST {id}` routes dispatch through `WopiOverrideMatcherPolicy` so each `X-WOPI-Override` value keeps its own authorization policy. This is the main server library.
- **WopiHost.Discovery** — Discovers WOPI client capabilities from Office Online Server XML.
- **WopiHost.Url** — Generates WOPI URLs for file/container actions.
- **WopiHost.Cobalt** — Optional MS-FSSHTTP (Cobalt) protocol support for co-authoring.
- **WopiHost.FileSystemProvider** — Default file-system-based storage provider. Resource identifiers are deterministic SHA-256 hashes of the path (see `WopiResourceId.FromCanonicalPath`); the in-memory id↔path map is rebuilt on startup.
- **WopiHost.MemoryLockProvider** — Default in-memory lock provider (per-instance `ConcurrentDictionary`, 30-min expiry). Single-process only.
- **WopiHost.AzureStorageProvider** — Azure Blob storage provider (alternative to FileSystemProvider). See its README for the connection-string config flow.
- **WopiHost.AzureLockProvider** — Azure-blob-backed distributed lock provider (alternative to MemoryLockProvider). Strongest cross-instance exclusion via Azure blob leases.
- **WopiHost.RedisLockProvider** — Redis-backed distributed lock provider. Best-effort, single-Redis (does not implement Redlock — see its README for rationale). Atomicity via Lua scripts; TTL-driven WOPI expiry.
- **WopiHost.Abstractions.Testing** — Shared `LockProviderConformanceTests` xUnit class that every `IWopiLockProvider` implementation runs through. Provider-specific test projects derive a sealed subclass and supply a factory; xUnit picks up the inherited `[Fact]` tests automatically. Adding a future provider = one more conformance subclass.

### Dependency Chain

```
Abstractions ← Discovery ← Core
Abstractions ← Url ← (depends on Discovery)
Abstractions ← FileSystemProvider
Abstractions ← AzureStorageProvider
Abstractions ← MemoryLockProvider
Abstractions ← AzureLockProvider
Abstractions ← RedisLockProvider
Abstractions ← Cobalt
Abstractions ← Abstractions.Testing (test-helper library; depends on xunit)
```

### Provider Model

Each storage / lock provider package exposes a typed `services.Add{Provider}{StorageOrLock}Provider(...)` extension. The composition root references the provider package(s) it wants and calls the extension directly — no reflection, no assembly-name strings. Available extensions: `AddFileSystemStorageProvider(cfg)`, `AddAzureStorageProvider(cfg)`, `AddMemoryLockProvider()`, `AddAzureLockProvider(cfg)`, `AddRedisLockProvider(cfg)`. The sample retains a small sample-local discriminator (`Sample:StorageProvider`, `Sample:LockProvider`) so the AppHost flag flow can flip providers at runtime — see [sample/WopiHost/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs](sample/WopiHost/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs).

### Infrastructure (infra/)

- **WopiHost.AppHost** — .NET Aspire orchestrator for local development. The backend is pinned at `:5000` (the WOPI host URL is referenced by Collabora's `host.docker.internal:5000`); the frontend and validator use `WithHttpsEndpoint()` so Aspire allocates their ports from the OS's free pool — the dashboard shows whatever was bound.
- **WopiHost.ServiceDefaults** — Shared service configuration: OpenTelemetry, health checks, HTTP resilience, service discovery.

### Sample Apps (sample/)

- **WopiHost** — Backend WOPI server sample.
- **WopiHost.Web** — Frontend that integrates with a WOPI client (Office Online / Collabora). Anonymous access; folder browsing + tabular file listing.
- **WopiHost.Web.Oidc** — Same role as WopiHost.Web but with OIDC sign-in. Per-resource permissions baked into the WOPI access token are derived from OIDC role claims via `OidcRolePermissionMapper`.
- **WopiHost.Validator** — WOPI protocol validation/testing tool.

### AppHost opt-in flags

The Aspire AppHost reads a few `AppHost:*` flags from configuration so the default first-run flow stays minimal. Set them in `infra/WopiHost.AppHost/appsettings.Development.json`:

| Flag | Adds |
|---|---|
| `AppHost:UseAzureStorage` | Azurite emulator + `BlobStorage` connection string forwarded to the WOPI host. |
| `AppHost:UseRedisLocks` | **Default: `true` when launched via the AppHost.** Adds a Redis container; the WOPI host swaps `Sample:LockProvider` to `Redis` (so `AddSampleLockProvider` dispatches to `AddRedisLockProvider`) and receives the Aspire-allocated connection string via `Wopi:LockProvider:ConnectionString`. Set to `false` to fall back to `Memory` (single-process) — useful on contributor machines without Docker. Aspire already manages Docker resources, so the realistic distributed-lock backend is the right default for the orchestrated dev loop. |
| `AppHost:UseCollabora` | `collabora/code` container as a real WOPI client for end-to-end editing. Auto-overrides `Wopi:ClientUrl`, `Wopi:HostUrl`, `Wopi:Discovery:NetZone`, and `Wopi:Security:DisableProofValidation` on the affected projects. See the **End-to-end editing with Collabora Online** section in the root README for the full wiring (`host.docker.internal:5000`, NetZone gotcha, proof-key gotcha). |
| `AppHost:IncludeOidcSample` | `WopiHost.Web.Oidc` frontend (requires IdP setup — see its README). |

Never commit `appsettings.Development.json` with these flags enabled — they impose external dependencies on every contributor.

## Key WOPI Concepts

- WOPI operations are distinguished by `X-WOPI-Override` header values (LOCK, UNLOCK, PUT, DELETE, RENAME, etc.).
- `X-WOPI-Proof` headers provide cryptographic request validation from the WOPI client.
- File/container identifiers are opaque strings. The filesystem and Azure providers both derive ids via `WopiResourceId.FromCanonicalPath` (SHA-256 of a provider-canonicalized path, lower-case hex). Each provider canonicalizes its input the way the underlying store compares names — FS case-folds with `Path.GetFullPath(...).ToUpperInvariant()` because filesystems on Windows/macOS are case-insensitive; Azure passes the blob path as-is because Azure Blob Storage is case-sensitive.
- Locks auto-expire after 30 minutes per the WOPI spec.

## Sample-frontend conventions

When working on any of the sample frontends (`WopiHost.Web`, `WopiHost.Web.Oidc`, `WopiHost.Validator`), keep these cross-cutting invariants in mind — they aren't enforced by the type system:

- **Token `wopi:fperms` MUST be scoped by the requested action.** A "view" link must not mint a token containing `UserCanWrite`. OOS / M365 ship distinct view (`wv/wopiviewerframe.aspx`) and edit (`we/wopieditorframe.aspx`) URLs and so the URL alone enforces the mode — the bug is invisible there. Collabora ships a single `cool.html?` URL for both and derives view-vs-edit from `CheckFileInfo` permission flags, so an over-permissive token silently opens the file in edit mode regardless of which link the user clicked. The pattern: strip `UserCanWrite | UserCanRename` when `actionEnum != WopiActionEnum.Edit`, keep `UserCanAttend`/`UserCanPresent` (interaction-only flags).
- **`Wopi:Security:DisableProofValidation` is dev-only.** The flag exists in `sample/WopiHost` to swap `IWopiProofValidator` for a no-op when running against WOPI clients (like Collabora) that don't sign callbacks with proof keys. It throws on startup outside the Development environment so a stray production config cannot silently disable signature checking. The AppHost flips it on automatically when `AppHost:UseCollabora=true`.
- **Permission resolution lives in two places by design.** The host frontend bakes per-resource permissions into the access token at mint time (claim `wopi:fperms`), and the WOPI backend's `IWopiPermissionProvider` reads them back at `CheckFileInfo` time. Production hosts replace the default mapper with an ACL-store lookup keyed off the user's `sub` and the resource id; see `OidcRolePermissionMapper` for the seam.
