# WopiHost.Discovery Optimization

## Optimization Approach

The WopiHost.Discovery library has been optimized to improve performance by replacing repeated XML querying with a more efficient data structure approach.

### Before Optimization

Previously, the library would:
1. Parse the XML when first requested
2. Cache the resulting `XElement` nodes in memory
3. Query this XML structure repeatedly for each request (using LINQ expressions)

This approach had several disadvantages:
- Each lookup required traversing XML elements and evaluating attributes
- Complex LINQ queries were executed repeatedly
- The code wasn't optimized for the most common use cases

### After Optimization

The optimized implementation:
1. Parses the XML only once
2. Transforms it into optimized lookup data structures
3. Uses these data structures for instant O(1) lookups

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Structured Data Model

We created specific model classes:
- `ActionInfo`: Holds details about a specific WOPI action
- `AppInfo`: Represents an application with its supported extensions
- `WopiDiscoveryData`: Contains optimized lookup tables

### 2. Lookup-Optimized Data Structures

We implemented several lookup dictionaries:
- `ExtensionLookup`: Fast lookup to check if an extension is supported
- `ActionLookup`: Fast lookup of action info by extension and action enum
- `ExtensionToAppLookup`: Fast mapping from extension to app info

### 3. Eager Processing

The implementation now:
- Processes the entire XML document once
- Builds all lookup tables immediately
- Caches the processed data rather than raw XML

### 4. Simplified API Implementation

Each API method now:
1. Gets the cached processed data
2. Performs a simple dictionary lookup
3. Returns the result directly

## Performance Benefits

These optimizations provide:
- Much faster lookups (O(1) instead of multiple LINQ queries)
- Reduced memory pressure from repeated XML traversal
- Better maintainability with clearer code structure
- Better handling of large discovery files

## Caching

The implementation maintains the existing caching behavior using `AsyncExpiringLazy<T>`, but now caches the processed data model instead of raw XML elements.

## Usage

The API interface remains unchanged, ensuring backward compatibility while providing significantly improved performance.
